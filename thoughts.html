	<p>Why is everyone so angry now?
					12/26</p>
	<p>What really happens when you die? 12/26</p>
	<p>Why do people care so much about problems that affect them so little. If everyone minded their own buisness people could feel safe in their own skin. Id it because we as americans have everything so there is nothing left to do except get invloved with other peoples personal matters? 12/26</p>
